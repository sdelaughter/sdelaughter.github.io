I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the [UCSD Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA)](https://www.caida.org), and am continuing to work closely with my PhD thesis advisor [Dr. Karen Sollins](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/ana/People/Sollins.html) at the [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](http://csail.mit.edu).

My research is focused primarily on Denial of Service mitigation, and more broadly on the design and evaluation of network protocols and internet architectures.  I am also interested in Internet governance, censorship detection & avoidance, distributed consensus, and data visualization.

In my spare time I make [music](music.md), [pottery](pottery.md), and [video games](https://samdelaughter.itch.io).
