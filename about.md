Hi, I'm Sam! I'm a computer scientist whose research focuses on measuring Denial-of-Service vulnerabilities in the Internet, and on designing, implementing, and deploying more inherently DoS-resilient protocols and architectures.  My other research interests include Internet governance, privacy and anonymity, distributed consensus, peer-to-peer networks, and data visualization.

In my spare time I make [video games](https://snail-dream.itch.io), [pottery](pottery.md), and [music](music.md).
