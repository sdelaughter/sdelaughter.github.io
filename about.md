I am a computer scientist, game developer, potter, and musician.

My research has primarily focused on the design and analysis of network protocols, internet architectures, and other distributed systems.  I am interested in Denial-of-Service mitigation, Internet governance, privacy and anonymity, consensus protocols, data visualization, and many many other things.

You can read my [papers](research.md), play my [games](https://snail-dream.itch.io), look at some of my [pottery](pottery.md), and listen to my [music](music.md) for free.
