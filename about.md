I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [UCSD Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA)](https://www.caida.org), and am continuing to work closely with my PhD thesis advisor [Dr. Karen Sollins](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/ana/People/Sollins.html) at the [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](http://csail.mit.edu).

My research focuses on measuring Denial-of-Service vulnerabilities in the Internet, and on designing, implementing, and deploying more inherently DoS-resilient protocols and architectures.  My other research interests include Internet governance, privacy and anonymity, distributed consensus, peer-to-peer networks, and data visualization.

In my spare time I make [music](music.md), [pottery](pottery.md), and [video games](https://samdelaughter.itch.io).
