I've decided to start a blog to help keep track of my projects.

I'm not sure how often I'll post or what all I'll post about, but I expect it will mostly be programming-related.  Weird problems that come up in the course of my research, nice tools I find or make for dealing with them, dev logs for games I make, etc.

If you've stumbled here searching for answers to your own weird problem, hopefully I was able to help.
