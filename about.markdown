I am a doctoral student in the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL)](http://csail.mit.edu) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu). I'm currently working with [Dr. Karen Sollins](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/ana/People/Sollins.html) as a member of the [Advanced Network Architecture group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/ana/index.html).

My current research is focused on measuring and mitigating Denial of Service vulnerabilities; designing safe and secure network protocols; analyzing Linux system performance; and developing and migrating to [Future Internet Architectures](http://www.nets-fia.net). I'm also interested in Internet governance, information hiding, protocol obfuscation, and the detection and circumvention of censorship.

I am a proud member of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org) and a strong proponent of net neutrality, digital privacy rights, free and open source software, and equitable global Internet access.

In my spare time I make [music](https://sdlwdr.bandcamp.com), pottery, and [video games](https://samdelaughter.itch.io).
